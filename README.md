## Overview
  This is my solution for the order summary component challenge.

  I had fun doing this challenge, especially since I got so much better at guessing the sizes of different elements, and most importantly, at correctly structuring my HTML.

## My process
  I (think) structured my HTML correctly, then I added the styles using CSS, and for the layout I mostly used flexbox.

### Built with
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox

### What I learned
    I learned that when I can use flex, I should use flex. It's so much easier to use flex than to use margins and positions.
    I understand that there is going to be projects where I'll need to use positions and margins and grid, but if I can achieve the look I want using the easiest way, then I will do exactly that.

    I also learned to structure my HTML correctly throughout my journey with Frontend Mentor challenges.

### Continued development
  I'm gonna keep learning about correct HTML structure and correct CSS styling and layouting.
